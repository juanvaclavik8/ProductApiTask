Task Assignment
Imagine that you are creating a new application, and within it, assume the existence of a class ProductController with a method getProduct with the integer $id parameter.
Assume the existence of any API that will return the product name and stock quantity for a given product id. Your task is to

●	Write the getProduct method and service classes that will perform the above-described workflow.
●	Store API-call logs into a file, however, anticipate that we will want to store logs elsewhere (e.g. mongodb). Assume the existence of a class that adds new content to a given filename and path.
●	Assume the existence of a class that logs potential program errors and use it in case of API failure.

Also assume the existence of the necessary classes for the actual API calls.
